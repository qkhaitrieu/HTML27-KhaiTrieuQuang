      Java is one of the leading programming languages ​​in the software
      developer community. It is also used to teach computer science to
      beginners. Furthermore, Java is currently ranked 2nd in IEEE's ranking by
      its capabilities and popularity. Similar results can also be seen on
      Livecoding.tv, where Java is one of the most popular languages ​​used by
      professionals. Just like any other programming language, you can work in
      different fields and make a powerful impact. So, what can you do with the
      Java programming language? Let's explore the different possibilities of
      this language!

    <h3>Promote your Java programming skills and become a freelancer</h3>
    You have completed a lot of projects in Java language. All done perfectly,
    but you still haven't promoted to many people outside the repository on
    GitHub. This is very common in the community of programmers these days and
    it sucks because there is no way to showcase your skills. However, the art
    of recruiting today has changed a lot, the employer is more interested in
    how the programmer handles the work, not what he has done in the past. So,
    how do you meet the requirements and get yourself noticed? <br />

    There are many platforms where you can do this. For example, the website
    Livecoding.tv is a good choice where you can promote and build your
    portfolio for the freelancer market. Not only are you showing off your
    skills to the viewers on this site, but you are also building a portfolio
    for yourself. Unlike other traditional freelance platforms like UpWork, you
    build your portfolio visually, allowing potential clients to gauge your
